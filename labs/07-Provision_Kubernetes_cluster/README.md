 ## Setup GCP environment using `gcloud` tool

```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:~$ gcloud init
Welcome! This command will take you through the configuration of gcloud.

Your current configuration has been set to: [default]

You can skip diagnostics next time by using the following flag:
  gcloud init --skip-diagnostics

Network diagnostic detects and fixes local network connection issues.
Checking network connection...done.

Do you want to configure a default Compute Region and Zone? (Y/n)?  n

Created a default .boto configuration file at [/home/vagrant/.boto]. See this file and
[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config] for more
information about configuring Google Cloud Storage.
Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!

* Commands that require authentication will use name.surname@gmail.com by default
* Commands will reference project `sny-prg-dvs-01-01-00` by default
Run `gcloud help config` to learn how to change individual settings

This gcloud configuration is called [default]. You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects.
Run `gcloud topic configurations` to learn more.

Some things to try next:

* Run `gcloud --help` to see the Cloud Platform services you can interact with. And run `gcloud help COMMAND` to get help on any gcloud command.
* Run `gcloud topic --help` to learn about advanced features of the SDK like arg files and output formatting
```

## Enable some GCloud services

```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:~$ gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
vagrant@terraform-vm:~$ gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com
Operation "operations/acf.f4f17717-fed8-46bc-a4be-a0e351464caf" finished successfully.
vagrant@terraform-vm:~$ gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
Operation "operations/acf.09b94de4-283f-4e0e-bcb9-539cb33e071e" finished successfully.
vagrant@terraform-vm:~$ gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```

Move to the lab folder
```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:~$ cd ~/$GIT_REPO_NAME/labs/07-Provision_Kubernetes_cluster/
vagrant@terraform-vm:$ 
```

## Provision the Kubernetes cluster

After having changed the configurations within the `terraform.tfvars` file, provision the environment

```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:$ terraform init
terraform init
Initializing modules...

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
...
* provider.kubernetes: version = "~> 1.9"
* provider.null: version = "~> 2.1"
* provider.random: version = "~> 2.2"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:$  terraform plan
...
Plan: 9 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:$  terraform apply
```

Provisioning may take up to 20 minutes depending on the number of worker nodes you specified.
After the provision ends, you can type the following command to generate the kubeconfig file on the VM (be sure to specify a correct value for **--region** and **--project** parameters)

```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:solution$  gcloud beta container clusters get-credentials gke-cluster --region europe-west4 --project sny-prg-dvs-01-01-00
```

## Verify cluster state

To verify the cluster functionalities and the kubeconfig file setup, you may try the following commands:


```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:solution$  ls -l /home/vagrant/.kube/config
-rw------- 1 vagrant vagrant 2483 Sep 30 15:06 /home/vagrant/.kube/config
```

```console
vagrant@terraform-vm:solution$  kubectl cluster-info
